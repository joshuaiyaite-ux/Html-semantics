# User Registration Form (HTML5 Semantic Form)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a semantic HTML5-based **User Registration Form** created from provided specifications.  
The goal is to implement a structured, accessible, and standards-compliant HTML form without any CSS.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Form
The form collects a wide range of user information, organized into clear sections:
- Personal Information  
- Contact & Address  
- Preferences & Interests  
- Feedback & Additional Information  

Each section uses semantic HTML elements such as `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<label>`, and proper input types.
